I have created a car rental service platform that allows for a convenient and flexible car rental experience. Customers can rent a car from one location and drop it off at another, with the car marked as unavailable during the rental period.

In addition to the basic rental service, the platform offers extra features and protection options for an added fee. Payment can be made securely through integrated methods such as SSL Commerz.

The platform also includes an admin dashboard for managing the cars, rent requests, and site settings. This allows for a streamlined and efficient management process, ensuring that the car rental service runs smoothly. Whether you're a car rental company or an individual looking to rent out your own vehicles, this platform has everything you need to provide a top-notch rental service.

I'm always trying to improve the platform and expand my knowledge by implementing new features. This project has been a great way for me to continue learning and developing my skills as a programmer.
